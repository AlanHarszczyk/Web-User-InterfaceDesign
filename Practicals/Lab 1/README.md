Overall Idea: 
 An animal shelter based in Enniscorthy/hometown. The site would provide information on the owner
 and the general backstory. It would allow to view and adopt animals after filling a form.

Leaned Items:
 Overflow-specifies whether to clip the content or to add scrollbars when the content of an element is too big to fit in the specified area.

 Span and its use.

Issues:
Had to restart work.

Isuues connecting all files together including images and exterior links alongside css due to files not being recognized originally.

Managing the white area/spacing on the site.

Next Steps:
Make the application form.
