                        <p>URl(Uniform Resource Locator), they are web adresses that identify resources on the internet.
                            They consist of the protocol (e.g. htttp), domain name(e.g www.example.com) and path (e.g./page.html).
                            DNS(Domain Name System), translates human made domain names into IP adresses allowing for them to locate web servers by name rather than numerical IP adresses.
