            <h1>Backstory</h1>
            <p>Working on this project was my first dive into the world of 3D design using Maya.
               We were tasked with creating a castle, which served as a hands-on introduction to the basics of Maya and what it can do.
               Through this experience, I got a feel for how the program works and learned its essential functions.
               It was like unlocking a door to a whole new set of possibilities in digital design.
               This project laid the groundwork for my future endeavors, giving me the confidence and skills to tackle more complex projects down the road.</p>
