            <p>Working on this project was my first dive into the world of 3D design using Maya.
               We were tasked with creating a castle, which served as a hands-on introduction to the basics of Maya and what it can do.
               Through this experience, I got a feel for how the program works and learned its essential functions.
               It unlocked a door to a whole new set of possibilities in digital design.
               This project laid the groundwork for my future endeavors, giving me the confidence and skills to tackle more complex projects down the road.</p>

                For this project, I had to make a book from scratch.
                It went pretty smoothly, didn't run into any major issues.
                The best part was getting hands-on with texturing,
                figuring out how to make the pages and cover look close to a book.
                Getting into the basics of texturing really opened my eyes to the details that make a design pop.
                It gave me a newfound appreciation for the intricacies of materials and surfaces.
