            <p>I used Figma to mock up a redesign for Craigslist's website.
               I made improvements to make the site easier to use and more coherent.
               After gathering feedback through a quick survey, people found the changes helpful.
               They said the new design made it easier to navigate and less confusing compared to the original.</p>

          <p>This poster features a font I designed myself.
            It was initially conceived as a potential design 
            element for a game screen but ultimately remained as an idea.</p>

                I developed a website from the ground up for an animal shelter adoption site in my local community.
                This endeavor involved acquiring proficiency in Java programming to craft the site.
                Meeting specific design criteria, I ensured both aesthetic appeal and functional usability were required throughout the development process.
