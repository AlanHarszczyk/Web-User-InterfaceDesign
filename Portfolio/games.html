            <h1>Backstory</h1>
            <p>Introducing 'Looped Road,' a video game I created from scratch.
              It's a basic game where players guide a character through a looping road to reach a target number displayed on the screen.
              Along the way, players can slow down cars and speed up the game as they progress.
              I handled everything, from coding the game mechanics to designing the characters and visuals.</p>

          <h1>Backstory</h1>
          <p>I assumed leadership of the art team for a game project,
            during which I led the creation of numerous assets,
            including character sprites, enemies weapons and many more assets.
            Although the game is no longer accessible, my contributions endure through the left behind art of characters
            skins, as well as weapons and enemies crafted utilizing Aseprite.</p>

                I undertook a commission to assist a colleague in developing art assets for their game project.
                My responsibility involved crafting chibi stylized art sprites tailored for a bobble-like game.
                Although the game is no longer accessible, I hold ownership of the assets created for future potential use.
