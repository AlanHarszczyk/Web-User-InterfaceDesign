                This project represents my final work for an animation class.
                We had to come up with our own character, design concept art for it,
                and create three animations: idle, walk, and run.
                We also added different looks for the character.
                I chose to make a fun, old-school cartoon robot and gave it costumes like pirate, vampire, or prehistoric themes.
                It's kind of like SpongeBob in style, you know, simple and playful.
                I used Photoshop to create all the designs and concept art.
